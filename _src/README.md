## CKAN

The least you need is CKAN itself

Clone CKAN:

	git clone https://github.com/pwr-inf/ckan.git
	git checkout ckan-2.5.2
## Extensions

Clone them here as well
	git clone https://github.com/pwr-inf/ckanext-oauth2-1.git
	git clone https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-stats.git
## Dependencies

Pip requirements are installed when the image is built.
All you need is a reqirement file named `requirements.txt` or `pip-requirements.txt`
